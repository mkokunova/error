<h2>Statement 1</h2>

<p> I'm writing in the presence of the glass which is on the table in front of me, 2 sm away from the sheet of paper I'm writing on.</p>
<p>Near there is a lamp on the wall. The light is on.</p>

<script src="js/mystatement_1.js"></script>


<h2>Statement 2</h2>

<p>What to put first - towels or soap?</p>

<script src="js/mystatement_2.js"></script>

<p>Drag the image into the rectangle:</p>

<div id="div1" ondrop="drop(event)" ondragover="allowDrop(event)"></div>

<img id="drag1" src="assets/img/soap-bar.jpg" draggable="true" ondragstart="drag(event)" width="128" height="69">
<img id="drag2" src="assets/img/towel.jpg" draggable="true" ondragstart="drag(event)" width="128" height="69">

<h2>Statement 3</h2>

<p>On all counts I was to feel worse today. But I'm well.</p>
<p>It's illogic</p>

<script src="js/mystatement_3.js"></script>


<h2>Statement 4</h2>

<p>I've developed a program that controls my day minute by minute.</p>
<p> I've got 2 minutes to get myself dressed and brushed before it's time to consume food.</p>

<h2>Statement 5</h2>

<p> It seems there is something in my nose. And there is also some tightness in my throat.</p>

<h2>Statement 6</h2>

<p> On all counts I was to feel worse today. But I'm well.
It's illogic.</p>

<script src="js/mystatement_6.js"></script>

<h2>Statement 7</h2>

<p> I'm not at all sure already that my home is safe. It seems the walls are not absolutely
vertical.</p>
